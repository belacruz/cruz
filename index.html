        <h2>You do not rise to the level of your goals, you fall to the level of your systems</h2>
        <p> Goals are good for setting a direction but systems are best for making progress. achieving a goal is only a
          momentary change. If you dont change your habits, than after reaching a goal, you will slip into your old
          patterns.</p>
        <p>Winners and losers have the same goals. We think we need to change our results, but results are
          not the problem, we need to change the system that causes
          that result.</p>

        If we think about an ice cube in a room at -10°C degrees, it will not melt since the temperature is bellow 0.
        As we start to increase the heat nothing seems to change at first, even when the room is already at -1°C the
        ice
        cube still looks the same. Finally when the temperature in the room reaches 1°C the ice begins to melt. What
        happened is that, even tho the progress was not making any big difference at first, it was accumulating and
        being stored, at one point the progress finally tips the balance.
      </p>
      <p>
        The same happens to progress in life, at first nothing seems to change, but after some time doing an expecific
        activity, the balance tips and the results start coming fast. People will call it an overnight success, but in
        reality, it
        took time and effort.
      </p>
      <p>Unfortunately it creates what we call "valley of disappointment", where our expectations about what should
        happen meet what actually happens, and we are left in a void of progress for a time before the results come.

        times
        without as much as a crack showing in it. Yet at the hundred and first blow it will split in two, and I know
        it
        was not that last blow that did it, but all that had gone before."

          <p>
            Goals create an "either or" situation: Either you achieve your goal or you fail and are a disappointment.
            You're not happy until you achieve your goal, and when you finally achieve it, soon you find yourself empty
            and sad because you don't have another goal, or because it wasn't good enough. It makes no sense to restric
            your satisfaction to one scenario when there are many paths to success.

          <h3>Systems-first mentality</h3>
          <p>
            Goals are at odds with long term progress. When all your hard work is set after a goal, what is left after
            you achieve it? A systems-first mentality provides the antidote. When you fall in love with the process
            rather
            than the
            product, you don't have to wait to give yourself permission to be happy. You can be satisfied anytime your
            system is
            running. And a system can be successful in many different forms, not just the one you first envision.

          <h3>Find the right system</h3>
          <p>
            If you're having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn't you. The problem is your system. Bad habits
            repeat themselves again and again not because you don't want to change, but because you have the wrong
            system for change.
